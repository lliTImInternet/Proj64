# Proj64

Project64 is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition resource pack, thats adds Mario from [Super Mario 64](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64) to Minecraft Besrock Edition.

Mario can move freely in the Minecraft world and interact with it. However, he can't use his iconic moves, like the long jump, three jump or the BLJ, because the limitations in a resource packet don't allow me to add them.
