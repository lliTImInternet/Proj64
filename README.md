# Proj64

Project64 is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition resource pack, thats adds Mario from [Super Mario 64](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64) to Minecraft Besrock Edition.

Mario can move freely in the Minecraft world and interact with it. However, he can't use his iconic moves, like the long jump, tripple jump or the BLJ, because the limitations in a resource packet don't allow me to add them.

## To-do List

This is by far not the last version, because I still want to add things like:

- Multiplayer support:
Play with your friends as characters like Luigi, Peach, Yoshi and more!
- Better animations:
Adding certain animations like the jump or flight animation.
- Add sound effects:
Adding sound effects such as the jumping sound.

Note: Some of these items may never make it into the resource packet.
